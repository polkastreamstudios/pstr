# Project Description
[Polkastream Studios (PDAO)](https://polkastream.org/) is building an integrated and intelligently monetized platform for the over-the-top (OTT) streaming market. On the [Polkastream](https://polkastream.app/) platform, streamers can enjoy music, podcasts, movies, and TV shows. In return, all users are rewarded with the PSTR token, which is uniquely designed with incentivization and token-burning strategies for better rewards, long-term crypto market stability, and data security for all platform users.


# Tokenomics
The PSTR token is minted on [Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-smart-chain) with an initial maximum supply of one billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. PSTR is built with an Automated Reward Redistribution and Burn System (ARRBS) that includes:

- A 4% fee is automatically applied to all transactions, from which 3% is redistributed to holders, and the remaining 1%, up to 50% of the max supply, is permanently burned.
- After 50% of the maximum supply is burned, the fee remains at 4% with all of it redistributed to holders and 0% burned.

As an added token security and stability feature, PSTR has a limit of one million (1,000,000) tokens per transaction. This anti-slippage transaction limit is updateable through Polkastream Decentralized Autonomous Organization (PDAO) proposals made by the community.

# Utilities
- Users can earn immersive rewards through Polkastream’s Active Audio and Video Rewards (AAVR) program by listening to music and podcasts, as well as watching movies and TV shows.
- PSTR can be staked via [staking.polkastream.app](https://staking.polkastream.app/) in the various staking programs for an APY interest.
- As the governance token of the [Polkastream](https://polkastream.app/) OTT streaming platform, users can use PSTR to create proposals and vote on existing ones to bring any desired changes to the platform’s offerings.

# Disclaimers
- There is only one PSTR smart contract address on BSC and no other blockchains. Here it is again: [bscscan.com/address/0x3cdd71d99cb393928b74d549d4cb0a6ffe0a60a8](https://bscscan.com/address/0x3cdd71d99cb393928b74d549d4cb0a6ffe0a60a8). Please always confirm it before making any investment decisions.

- Until official announcements are made, the PSTR token cannot be bought or traded on any platform, whether it be a centralized exchange (CEX), a decentralized exchange (DEX), or a launchpad. The official Polkastream social media channels are accessible at [polkastream.app](https://polkastream.app), and all announcements of investment and/or pre-sale opportunities will be made via those socials. Anyone claiming that you can purchase PSTR otherwise is an impersonator. Be careful and aware of potential scammers.

- 100% of the PSTR token supply in the company’s possession will always be stored in the most secure and effective air-gapped wallet currently available in the market. This should provide complete security and safety from hacks, as air-gapped wallets are never connected to the internet and, therefore, cannot be hacked digitally.
